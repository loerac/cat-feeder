# Cat Feeder
Manually feeding your cats is a hassle. Automatic cat feeders are too expensive for what they do. So why not make one. It's only a motor turning to allow food to come out, how hard can it be to program that...

This is called "Cat Feeder" but I'm pretty sure it could feed a dog as well. I'm not so sure on that, I'll have to discuss that with the engineers of this project. I'll get back to this thought in a 3-5 business days.
